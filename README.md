build a 'Contact Us' web app with the following characteristics

The form captures at minimum: name, email address and message with the sort of form validation you would expect
A successful form submit writes the values into some form of local storage and should persist - at least - for the lifetime of the web app
The web app has to be a single page app i.e. the page should not physically refresh at any point during the user's interaction with the app

Your submission should be a project that utilises TypeScript with React and Redux. It is very important that your submission is able to build and run on our machines and so please provide everything that is required to install and run your solution.

Currently, we use Visual Studio along with the Webpack task runner for our transpiling needs - if this is not your workflow, it might also be worth supplying the generated JavaScript so that we're able to run your submission.

It is not necessary to build the backend component to this - however, it is recommended that there are at the very least mock APIs that your web app would consume.

We encourage you to build this using the techniques and methodologies that you use every day and if relevant/practical we would like for you to provide these as part of your submission (i.e. unit tests if you're into TDD, a Trello board if you tend to break things down into tasks Kanban style).
